Correlation of Suicide rates against Economical, Social, and Spiritual Factors
========================================================

In this presentation I try to find which factors correlates the most with suicide 
rates across the world. 
Data for suicide rates comes from Wikipedia: http://goo.gl/MVLE

The App can be found at: http://omargomez.shinyapps.io/Quandl1/
